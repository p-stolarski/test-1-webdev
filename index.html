<h3 style="font-family:courier;">Some information
</h3>
<p1>in my time at sault college i have found out about the true uniquness of college and how diffrent of a lifstyle it is compared to highschool. i have taken a computer programming course and i went into it thinking it wasent going to be much diffrent but i was proved wrong. the biggest thing to appreciate is the freedom there is so much more freedom to do what you will but that also comes with a load of responsibility to get your work done and be your own self advocate.i have met a few new freinds and its only been a few months and have learnt some valuable life skills and i can see more doors in life opening up for me by the week</p1>
